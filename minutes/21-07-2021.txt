We'll currently pause the msh forms and start creating an HAB fees verification app.

It should have 2 logins, one for students and other for caretaker.

The students section should have necessary fields like name, roll no., date of arrival etc.
We should also create a function to calculate the fee to be paid based on the date of arrival.

The caretaker section should have all the responses of that particular hostel in tabular form and on expanding 
all the details should be visible along with the fee reciept and the amount the student need to pay. 
On confirming an automated noreply mail with the cc as the hostel's id should be sent to the students.
