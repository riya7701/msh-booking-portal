We'll use the Django Models and Forms to store the complete data and not use any API.
Authentication to be done using Outlook.
There'll be two basic models, a user model and a forms model.
User model will store instances of users and forms model will store submissions of a particular form, say MSH.
Every form model will be linked to a User instance and will also include fields relevant to the particular form.
